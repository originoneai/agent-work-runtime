# Engineering assessment contract (DEC-010)

This page freezes the first-batch **reuse mapping**, **compatibility surface**,
and **AssessmentEnvelope** contract for model-free engineering assessment.
It does not authorize a second work/session authority, a general scheduler, a
model client, or a new Decision object. Management intensity, claim admission,
source write, and completion remain the existing protocols.

Verified against tip `main` at execution:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Verified main SHA | `8fa6679981c823842282a0a4b5b79b9c7165b2a4` |
| Branch tip when frozen | same SHA (worktree based on `main`) |
| Design snapshot (non-authoritative) | `e3bfac4ef0dd14b06f97eb4c972e90d62861a6d1` in the DEC pack |

The design pack's older SHA is inventory history only. Every reuse claim below
was re-checked against the verified main SHA above.

Machine-checkable companions live under
[`tests/fixtures/assessment/contracts/`](../../../tests/fixtures/assessment/contracts/).

## 1. Tip inventory and deltas

### 1.1 Already on tip main (reuse; do not reimplement)

| Surface | Tip symbols / entry points | What it already decides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Management intensity | `awr_core::{ManagementObservation,ManagementReason,ManagementMode,ManagementDecision,decide_management}`; `awr_runtime::{assess_management,manage_work}`; CLI `work assess` / `work manage`; MCP `awr_work_assess` / `awr_work_manage` | `undetermined` / `lightweight` / `continuous` from host assertions + runtime history; `unknown_observations`; `required_actions`; `reevaluation_signals`; never grants execution or changes completion policy |
| Prepare composition | `awr_runtime::prepare_work` embeds `management` beside readiness + context | Single snapshot with `ready`, `diagnostics`, `context`, `management`, continuity waits, and a stage `next_action` |
| Action rationale | `awr_core::ActionGuidance`; `awr_runtime::guide_prepared_work`; CLI/MCP `response_view=action` on prepare | One bounded `when` / `basis` / `next_action` / `recheck` card; omits only presentation duplicates; preserves incomplete diagnostics |
| Status queues | `awr_runtime::action_status(_page)` via `status --view action` | Four queues `current` / `ready` / `waiting` / `blocked` with recorded waits and non-terminal executions (not live process probes) |
| Context completeness | `awr_context::{ContextCompleteness,assess_completeness,hard_context,select_rules,budget_context}` | Required sources/rules/deps/acceptance; budget packing and omit reasons |
| Completion / evidence | `awr_core` completion validators; `prepare_completion` / `work complete` path | Source-bound evidence levels; unknown level is not a pass |
| Capability catalog | CLI `capabilities` id `work.management`; MCP tool list includes assess/manage/prepare | Advertise existing commands; build catalog is not project authorization |

### 1.2 Explicit deltas introduced by DEC-010

| Item | Tip today | DEC-010 freeze |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared AssessmentEnvelope | Separate JSON shapes per entry (`management` object, prepare envelope, action guidance, status queues) | One typed envelope schema for first-batch explain; maps existing returns without replacing them |
| Facts / observation / inference labels | Present as scattered strings (`observation_basis`, diagnostic codes, completeness issues) | Fixed classification vocabulary and field `state` / `basis` enums |
| Five semantic layers | Computed by different modules; not named as one layer set | Named layers with per-layer support status; unchecked layers are `not_evaluated`, never false |
| Explain delivery | Full assess JSON always; prepare embeds management; action view omits some management identity fields | Capability-negotiated explain field/view on **existing** prepare/assess paths; **no** new command name; **do not** occupy `decision show` |
| Unsupported / future fields | Absent keys | Explicit `unknown` (never zero-fill, never coerce to false/low-risk) |
| Scheduler / model client / Decision authority | Absent from assessment path | Remain out of scope for DEC-010 and the first batch |

Historical EVO-010 / EVO-012 / EVO-034 semantics that landed as the management,
prepare embedding, and status-action surfaces above are reused. DEC-010 does not
open a second rule engine for those conclusions.

## 2. First-batch scope

First batch (through the DEC-2 explain loop) **only**:

1. **Management assessment explanation** — typed wrap of the existing
   `ManagementDecision` / assess receipt.
2. **Action-rationale explanation** — typed wrap of existing `ActionGuidance`
   produced for prepare `response_view=action` (and the matching status action
   card shape).

Out of first batch for the DEC-010 envelope itself (later DEC cards; keep layers
as `not_evaluated` or field `state=unsupported` until implemented):

- Bounded fact-snapshot + source-quality labeling (DEC-011) — types and pure
  construction land in `awr_core::fact_snapshot` / `awr_runtime::fact_snapshot`;
  fixtures under `tests/fixtures/assessment/signals/`. WorkspaceFacts only via
  host supply or explicit collection; prepare does not run Git/AST/network.
- Typed AssessmentEnvelope compose + unknown/conflict semantics (DEC-012) —
  `awr_core::assessment_envelope` (`compose_assessment_envelope` /
  `evaluate_assessment`); fixtures under `tests/fixtures/assessment/envelope/`.
- Counterexample corpus (DEC-013)
- Composition pipeline (DEC-020) — `awr_runtime::explanation_chain` (`compose_explanation_chain`); binds five-layer explanations + advisories on existing prepare/assess judgments without a second adjudicator. CLI/MCP field injection is DEC-021 (`assessment.explain` on existing prepare/assess).
- Context packing / retention explain (DEC-030+)
- AUTO / model routing (never core)

## 3. Five semantic layers

Layers are independent. A layer that was not run returns `not_evaluated`.
Missing evidence is `unknown` / `missing`, never `false`.

| Layer id | Tip authority today | First-batch envelope role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `work_readiness` | `Store::work_readiness` diagnostics, active claims, dependency projection used by prepare/assess | Map readiness `ready` + diagnostic codes into assessments; do not invent readiness |
| `execution_admission` | Claim/session/permission paths; management sets `execution_admission: "not_granted_by_management_classification"`; team prepare reports `"not_evaluated"` | First batch records the tip constant / not_evaluated; never treat management continuous mode as admission |
| `context_completeness` | `ContextCompleteness` inside prepare `context` | Explain selected completeness flags and issues when present; otherwise `not_evaluated` |
| `delivery_observation` | Status waiting queue + non-terminal executions + MCP waits; host must query executors | Map recorded unknown outcomes / waits; never claim a live process was stopped |
| `completion_validity` | Completion/evidence validators and ordinary-confirmation policy | First batch only echoes that management does **not** change `completion_policy` (`unchanged_source_policy`); full validity checks stay on the completion path |

## 4. Facts, observations, and inference

Every signal in an envelope carries:

| Field | Allowed values / meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `state` | `known` | `missing` | `stale` | `conflicting` | `unsupported` | `unknown` |
| `basis` | `source_declared` | `runtime_recorded` | `host_asserted` | `locally_observed` | `rule_derived` |
| Classification | **fact** = source/runtime recorded value with identity; **observation** = host-asserted or locally observed, not independently verified; **inference** = rule_derived suggestion that must never be written as verified fact |

Tip mapping examples:

- `ManagementObservation.*` host fields → observation, `basis=host_asserted`, assess receipt `observation_basis=host_assertion_not_independently_verified`
- Runtime events (`mcp.wait_created`, `work.handoff`, `session.resumed`, non-terminal executions) → fact/observation with `basis=runtime_recorded` / reason basis `runtime_history` or `runtime_recorded_state`
- Source dependency / contract fingerprint mismatches → `basis=source_projection` / `source_declared` as appropriate
- `required_actions` / advisory suggestions → inference / advisory only; still require the next real admission check
- Omitted optional counters (`active_elapsed_ms`, `completed_rework_cycles`) → `missing` / listed in `unknown_observations`; never treated as zero risk

## 5. AssessmentEnvelope schema (frozen)

Schema id: `awr-assessment-envelope-v1`. Version: `1`. First-batch
`assessment_profile`: `management_and_action_rationale`.

```json
{
  "schema_id": "awr-assessment-envelope-v1",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "assessment_profile": "management_and_action_rationale",
  "identity": {
    "project_id": null,

  "legacy": {
    "compatible": true,
    "source_views": [],
    "omitted_fields": []

  "unsupported_fields": {}
}
```

Rules:

- `null` and `unknown` mean unset / not independently established. Do not
  substitute `0`, `false`, or empty-success.
- `assessments[].support` ∈ `supported` | `unknown` | `conflicting` | `unsupported`.
- `advisory_actions[].code` must come from the frozen advisory set below (machine
  enums, not free-form scripts).
- `unsupported_fields` maps dotted paths → `"unknown"` for any profile field the
  implementation does not yet populate.
- Evaluation is read-only: no model, network, thread farm, or claim/completion
  side effects from producing an envelope.

### 5.1 Management object (reuse mapping)

Maps 1:1 from tip `assess_management` / `ManagementDecision`:

| Envelope path | Tip source |
| --- | --- |
| `management.decision.version` | `ManagementDecision.version` (=1) |
| `management.decision.mode` | `undetermined` | `lightweight` | `continuous` |
| `management.decision.reasons[]` | `{code,basis,reference}` |
| `management.decision.unknown_observations[]` | unknown host fields |
| `management.decision.reevaluation_signals[]` | elapsed / rework signals |
| `management.decision.required_actions[]` | required maintenance strings |
| `management.decision.optional_maintenance[]` | optional strings (may be omitted in action view) |
| `management.decision.completion_policy` | always `unchanged_source_policy` |
| `management.decision.execution_admission` | always `not_granted_by_management_classification` |
| `management.contract_fingerprint` | assess receipt |
| `management.observation` / `observation_basis` / `admission_gaps` / `record_required` / `next_action` | assess receipt |

### 5.2 Action-rationale object

Maps from tip `ActionGuidance` / prepare action view / status action guidance:

| Envelope path | Tip source |
| --- | --- |
| `action_rationale.when` | `ActionGuidance.when` |
| `action_rationale.basis` | `ActionGuidance.basis` |
| `action_rationale.next_action` | `ActionGuidance.next_action` |
| `action_rationale.recheck` | `ActionGuidance.recheck` |
| `action_rationale.max_bytes` | `ACTION_GUIDANCE_MAX_BYTES` (1024) |
| `action_rationale.response_view` | `full` | `summary` | `action` when applicable |

## 6. Frozen reason codes and bases

### 6.1 Management reason `code` values (tip)

Host-assertion triggers from `decide_management`:

- `multiple_outcomes`
- `scope_requires_planning`
- `handoff_or_collaboration`
- `deferred_wait`
- `plan_invalidated`
- `query_outcome_before_retry`
- `independent_work_units`

Runtime / projection reasons from `assess_management`:

- `unresolved_dependencies` (`basis=source_projection`)
- `work_contract_changed` (`basis=source_projection`)
- `persistent_wait` (`basis=runtime_history`)
- `work_handoff` (`basis=runtime_history`)
- `cross_session_resume` (`basis=runtime_history`)
- `execution_result_requires_query` (`basis=runtime_recorded_state`)
- `continuous_management_retained` (`basis=runtime_history`)

Reason `basis` values observed on tip: `host_assertion`, `runtime_history`,
`source_projection`, `runtime_recorded_state`.

### 6.2 Unknown observation field names

When absent on the host observation: `single_outcome`, `bounded_scope`,
`single_executor`, `no_deferred_wait`, `plan_valid`, `outcome_known`,
`independently_schedulable_units`.

### 6.3 Reevaluation signals

- `active_elapsed_at_least_30_minutes` (when `active_elapsed_ms >= 30*60*1000`)
- `at_least_3_completed_rework_cycles` (when `completed_rework_cycles >= 3`)

These request reassessment only; they do **not** auto-promote lightweight work.

### 6.4 Required / optional action strings

Always required (all modes):

- `preserve_identity_intent_scope_and_current_state`
- `consume_required_context_and_hard_rules`
- `retain_completion_basis_and_actual_outcome`
- `check_source_versions_permissions_claims_and_request_identity`

Additional when `continuous`:

- `maintain_dependencies_and_ownership`
- `checkpoint_at_wait_handoff_interruption_and_phase_change`
- `maintain_next_action_wait_conditions_and_open_loops`
- `query_unknown_results_before_any_retry`

Conditional:

- `assess_unknown_management_facts` (undetermined + unknowns)
- `reevaluate_scope_plan_and_recovery_without_automatic_upgrade` (reevaluation signals)

### 6.5 First-batch advisory action codes

Closed set for envelope `advisory_actions` (aligns to tip required actions /
guidance; not executable scripts):

- `continue_prepare_current_work`
- `query_original_operation_result`
- `collect_user_reply`
- `refresh_sources`
- `repair_required_materials`
- `inspect_claim_conflict`
- `request_human_review`
- `record_management_observations`
- `no_advisory`

## 7. Read boundaries

Assessment reads may use:

- Already-authorized project store projections and event receipts
- The same read snapshot prepare/assess already opened
- Explicit caller-supplied host observations (labeled host-asserted)
- Fixture / frozen policy inputs for offline replay

Assessment reads must not:

- Open a model provider or any network scoring path
- Probe live OS processes to invent execution outcomes
- Run implicit `git` / AST / whole-repo scans beyond what prepare already did
- Mutate claims, sessions, sources, completion, or management records
  (recording observations remains the separate `work manage` mutation)
- Bypass source freshness / revision guards that the caller already faces
- Treat `decision show` content or markdown decision documents as this envelope

TOCTOU: an envelope is an explanation of a past snapshot. The next mutating
operation must re-check permissions, claims, and source versions.

## 8. Legacy output compatibility

| Existing consumer output | Compatibility strategy |
| --- | --- |
| `awr work assess` / `awr_work_assess` JSON | Remain authoritative for management. Envelope maps from it; do not rename tip fields. |
| `awr work prepare` / `awr_work_prepare` `management` object | Remain embedded. Explain adds an **optional** negotiated field/view; default `full` unchanged. |
| `response_view=summary` | Keep omitting only `context.work_context.selected_*` indexes as today. |
| `response_view=action` | Keep guidance card + existing omitted management identity/optional fields. Envelope action-rationale mirrors guidance without dropping required context. |
| `status --view action` queues | Unchanged; later layers may cite queue items as delivery_observation refs. |
| `decision show` / `object show` | **Not used** for assessment explain. Capability negotiation must not overload those commands. |
| MCP grouped tool contracts | New explain fields appear only when the client negotiates the capability / view; unnegotiated clients keep prior shapes. |

Capability id `assessment.explain` is wired in DEC-021 as an optional `--explain` /
`explain` boolean on existing prepare/assess commands (orthogonal to
`response_view` full/summary/action). Do **not** invent `work assess-explain`
or similar for first batch.

## 9. Two read consumers

| Consumer | Tip entry | First-batch explain role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI | `awr work assess`, `awr work prepare [--response-view …]`, `awr capabilities` | Same envelope bytes as MCP when inputs match; negotiate explain without new verbs |
| MCP | `awr_work_assess`, `awr_work_prepare` (`response_view` full/summary/action) | Same; reads persist nothing; SourceStale still requires explicit reindex |

Both consumers remain read-only for assessment. Closing MCP does not end sessions.
Unknown mutation outcomes still require querying the original request identity.

## 10. Unsupported fields → `unknown`

Any envelope field listed in the profile but not produced by the current
implementation is emitted under `unsupported_fields` with value `"unknown"`,
or as a layer/assessment with `status` / `support` = `not_evaluated` /
`unsupported`. Forbidden coercions:

- missing git diff ↛ `changed_lines=0`
- missing observation ↛ `false` risk absence
- unknown execution ↛ “safe to retry”
- rule score ↛ calibrated probability
- inference ↛ verified fact

## 11. Invariants

- `no_model_or_network_required`
- `source_first_single_work_authority`
- `reuse_existing_admission_and_completion`
- `unknown_is_not_false_or_zero`
- `evidence_coverage_is_not_probability`
- `no_second_decision_authority`
- `decision_show_not_occupied`

## 12. DEC-011 fact snapshot (bound inputs)

Schema id: `awr-fact-snapshot-v1`. Pure `build_fact_snapshot` accepts fixed
identity (project/work/branch, contract + source versions), `as_of`, scope,
truncation/limits, and labeled `FactSignal` values. Same-snapshot entity
version conflicts are rejected. Signal `state` /
`basis` / classification distinguish missing, stale, conflicting, unsupported,
host-asserted observations, and verified facts. Without a bound git diff,
`changed_lines` and low-risk labels stay unset (never `0` / `low`). Runtime
mapping reuses one prepared/assess read view (`scan_ops=1`) and does not
recurse the repository.

Machine fixtures: `tests/fixtures/assessment/signals/`.

## 13. DEC-012 typed envelope compose (unknown / conflict)

Schema id remains `awr-assessment-envelope-v1`. Pure
`compose_assessment_envelope` / `evaluate_assessment` accept fixed identity,
versioned `AssessmentPolicy`, `as_of`, optional `FactSnapshot`, optional
`ManagementDecision` / `ActionGuidance`, and labeled sub-assessments.

| Rule | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Support vocabulary | `supported` / `unknown` / `conflicting` / `unsupported` on each assessment; layers add `not_evaluated` |
| Preserve raw conclusions | Each sub-assessment keeps its original `conclusion`; compose does not rewrite unknown → false / low-risk |
| Conflict priority | Aggregate / layer merge uses Conflicting > Unknown > Unsupported > Supported > NotEvaluated |
| Reason order | Policy `reason_code_order` sorts reason codes and assessment surfacing deterministically (no expression DSL) |
| Hard gate (`hard_gate`) | `hard_reject` or hard reason codes → `Reject` / `Unknown`; heuristic scores never clear the gate |
| Evidence quality | `required` / `observed` / `missing` / `stale` / `conflicting` / `unsupported` + `applicability` separately; coverage note is a field-count ratio, not probability |
| Resource limits | Caps on assessments / advisory / candidates / return bytes; truncation sets `omitted_count` and must not claim Pass/full scan |
| Replay | Same input + policy + `as_of` → identical `assessment_hash` |
| Forbidden | Uncalibrated `confidence` / `probability` / `calibrated_probability` / `p_success` on conclusions |

Machine fixtures: `tests/fixtures/assessment/envelope/`.


## 14. DEC-013 counterexample corpus and compare budgets

Pre-registers the offline counterexample corpus, baseline/candidate compare
contract, performance budget slots, and statistics 口径 **before** the first
candidate explain run. Reuses EVO-001 pre-registration method but counts
separately; does not require EVO paid/dual-host experiments.

| Item | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Coverage matrix + C01–C20 + P01–P05 | `tests/fixtures/assessment/counterexamples/` |
| Compare contract / budgets / script | `tests/benchmarks/assessment/` |
| Operator doc | [`docs/benchmarks/assessment.md`](../benchmarks/assessment.md) |

Metric families stay separate: structural correctness, runtime overhead, and
advisory effectiveness. Model success rate, dollar savings, and semantic
understanding are not derived from unmeasured data. Critical hard-constraint
families (error retry, revoke, wrong task, evidence withdrawal, missing fields,
delivery unknown, time budget) fail closed and are not offset by averages.

Envelope stack marker: `tests/fixtures/assessment/envelope/manifest.json`
sets `dec_013_started: true`.

## 15. DEC-020 explanation chain (prepare / management binding)

Consumes the DEC-010..013 public bases (`FactSnapshot`, `AssessmentEnvelope`,
counterexample corpus) and attaches a five-layer explanation chain on top of
**existing** prepare/assess conclusions. EVO-012 still owns behavior fixes.

| Item | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Entry | `awr_runtime::{compose_explanation_chain, explanation_chain_from_prepare_json}` |
| Profile | `prepare_explanation_chain_v1` (schema id remains `awr-assessment-envelope-v1`) |
| Layers | Maps `work_readiness` / `execution_admission` / `context_completeness` / `delivery_observation` / `completion_validity` from prepare + management receipts; unchecked facets stay `not_evaluated` with explicit unchecked notes |
| Advisories | Finite `ADVISORY_ACTION_CODES` only; unresolved side effects → sole advice `query_original_operation_result` |
| Forbidden re-run cues | Never advise re-run from `high_coverage` / `low_risk` / `small_change` (and aliases) |
| Invalidation | `prior_explanation_still_valid` — source/contract/auth change or stop/revoke invalidates cached explanations |
| Unsupported probes | Explicit `ProbeSupport::Unsupported` → `unknown`; must not claim a real process was stopped |
| Replay | Same prepare inputs + policy + `as_of` → identical `assessment_hash` |

Machine tests: `crates/awr-runtime/tests/explanation_chain.rs` (acceptance + C01/C03/C07/C08/C15/P01 reuse).

Corpus marker: `tests/fixtures/assessment/counterexamples/manifest.json` sets
`dec_020_started: true`.

## 16. DEC-021 optional CLI/MCP explanation delivery

Wires capability `assessment.explain` onto **existing** `work prepare` /
`work assess` and MCP `awr_work_prepare` / `awr_work_assess` paths. Reuses
DEC-020 `explanation_chain` / `AssessmentEnvelope` — no second adjudicator,
no new top-level tool, and `decision show` remains unoccupied.

| Item | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Capability | `assessment.explain` in CLI `capabilities` (negotiable via `--require`) |
| CLI flag | `work prepare --explain`, `work assess --explain` (default **off**) |
| MCP arg | optional boolean `explain` (default false); `response_view` enum stays `full`/`summary`/`action` |
| Field | `assessment_explanation` on the same prepare/assess receipt |
| Shared result | CLI and MCP attach via `awr_runtime::attach_assessment_explanation`; identical inputs → identical `assessment_hash` |
| Default cost | No extra tool round-trip; explanation is derived from the prepare/assess body already returned |
| No duplication | Envelope cites `basis_refs`; must not re-embed `rendered_context` (`prepare_context_duplicated=false`) |
| Metrics | Reports both full wire bytes (`wire_bytes`) and `rendered_context_bytes` separately |
| Side effects | `claimed_work` / `updated_completion` / `auto_invoked_tools` / `model_or_network` all false |
| Capability off | Omit `--explain` / `explain:true` → legacy shapes unchanged (C20) |

Machine tests: `crates/awr-cli/tests/assessment_explain_cli.rs`,
`crates/awr-mcp/tests/assessment_explain_mcp.rs`,
`awr_runtime::assessment_explain` unit tests.

Corpus marker: `tests/fixtures/assessment/counterexamples/manifest.json` sets
`dec_021_started: true`.

## 17. DEC-022 offline replay, shadow compare, and one-click disable

Ships **developer** offline replay + shadow compare entry points and an advice
delivery kill-switch on top of DEC-010..021 (`FactSnapshot`, `AssessmentEnvelope`,
`explanation_chain`, optional explain). Reuses event/artifact-shaped snapshot
JSON for bounded facts + rule hashes — **no separate state DB**. Assessment stays
read-only: no model/network, missing fields stay missing, unknown ≠ false.

| Item | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Snapshot schema | `awr-assessment-replay-snapshot-v1` (`ReplaySnapshot`) |
| Replay entry | `awr_runtime::{capture_replay_snapshot,replay_assessment,replay_assessment_from_bytes}`; CLI `awr assessment replay [--snapshot PATH]` |
| Missing snapshot | Status `not_replayable` with explicit reason — never silent/fake success |
| Replay bounds | Recomputes fixed inputs only; `reread_production_state=false`, `reran_tools=false`, `model_or_network_requests=false` |
| Shadow compare | `awr_runtime::shadow_compare`; CLI `awr assessment compare --baseline … --candidate …` |
| Compare dimensions | Same-input reasons, advisory codes, hard rejects, costs; diffs cite rule/policy version hashes; divergent samples retained in full |
| Shadow adoption | `execution_adoption=false`, `context_adoption=false` for shadow **and** enabled; this card does not adopt advice into execution or context; **no background daemon** |
| Costs | Collect and judge samples stay absent until measured. Only serialized envelope bytes are recorded. A candidate that loosens a hard gate or drops a hard reject does not pass. |
| Advice modes | `disabled` (kill-switch) / `shadow` / `enabled` via `AdviceDeliveryMode` |
| Kill-switch | `disabled` restores prior advice behavior only (omit new explain); **does not** remove claim/completion/admission/source-freshness/stop-revoke hard protections |
| Offline chain | prepare/explain → change source → `prior_explanation_still_valid=false` → reassess (see `assessment_offline` tests) |

Capabilities: `assessment.replay`, `assessment.shadow_compare`, `assessment.advice_mode`.

Machine tests: `crates/awr-runtime/tests/assessment_offline.rs`,
`crates/awr-cli/tests/assessment_offline_cli.rs`,
`crates/awr-runtime` unit tests under `assessment_replay` / `assessment_shadow`.

Fixtures: `tests/fixtures/assessment/replay/`.

Corpus marker: `tests/fixtures/assessment/counterexamples/manifest.json` sets
`dec_022_started: true`.


## 18. DEC-060 first-batch independent acceptance gate

Independently accepts the first model-free explanation closed loop. Cross-checks
DEC-010..022 acceptance evidence item-by-item and counts **eight** first-batch
items separately (010/011/012/013/020/021/022 + this gate). Reuses existing
fixtures, offline replay, CLI/MCP explain, and kill-switch — **no second
assessment stack**.

| Item | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Evidence pack | `tests/fixtures/assessment/mvp-acceptance/` (checked-in stand-in for `.local/awr-decision-20260920/mvp-acceptance/`) |
| Acceptance note | `docs/benchmarks/assessment.md` §10 |
| Gate harness | `tests/benchmarks/assessment/prove_acceptance_dec060.py` |
| Offline re-run | `tests/benchmarks/assessment/run_offline_gate.py` [`--full`] |
| Perf raw | `mvp-acceptance/perf-raw/` retained; budgets not invented |
| Non-claims | Does **not** prove full 14-item suite, AUTO, Team, native host, or a released version |

Corpus marker: `tests/fixtures/assessment/counterexamples/manifest.json` sets
`dec_060_started: true`. `evo_000_started` / `dec_040_started` remain false.

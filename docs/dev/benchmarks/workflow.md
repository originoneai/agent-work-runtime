# Complete workflow costs and reliability

The [versioned contract](../../../tests/benchmarks/workflow/contract.json) compares two
ways of consuming the **same native runtime and initial source bytes**. The
primitive path reads work, management and context separately; the prepared path
uses `awr_work_prepare`. Both retain the same goals, hard rules, completion criteria,
claims, actual artifact checks, completion reports and source writes.

This is a comparison between equivalent supported API workflows. It is not a
comparison with doing no task management, a previous release, an optimized client
that already caches some observations, or another product. It does not establish
that every short task should use AWR.

## Recorded result

[Reviewed aggregate data](workflow-macos-arm64.json), measured on macOS arm64 with
the same **unoptimized development binaries** from source `4898e7122fb9`, after the completion-query regression fix and before
this measurement/documentation-only update. Three repetitions per strategy and
workload produce 30 complete runs; order alternates to reduce order bias.

| Workload | Primitive calls | Prepared calls | Returned text reduction | Whole workflow median, primitive → prepared |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Bounded lightweight work | 20 | 16 | 3.67% | 1,104 → 1,072 ms |
| Scope change and retained upgrade | 31 | 25 | 3.83% | 1,412 → 1,321 ms |
| Wait, server restart and reply | 30 | 22 | 4.68% | 1,800 → 1,710 ms |
| Verified dependency release | 39 | 31 | 3.74% | 1,599 → 1,541 ms |
| Lost result, restart and lookup | 22 | 18 | 3.45% | 1,212 → 1,131 ms |

Calls fall by 18–27%, but returned text decreases much less. The initial tool catalog
alone is about 30.8 KB of protocol output, and report/evidence/lifecycle maintenance
remains in both paths. Fewer calls are useful; they do not imply a large reduction
in total Agent context or cost.

The prepared query's observed median is 38.1 ms across 45 calls; its maximum is
533.6 ms. These samples include fresh-server context initialization. End-to-end
workflow durations include initialization and shutdown, protocol discovery, source
checks, expected rejections and persistence. Three workload repetitions are not a
latency SLO or a performance claim for optimized builds, large ledgers, or enterprise
concurrency. Per-operation sample counts, minima, maxima and medians are in the data.

All 30 runs passed the separate required-fact, false-completion, actual-completion,
identity, duplicate-execution and scenario-behavior checks. These checks establish
the tested behavior on these fixtures; they do not prove model comprehension or
general absence of defects. Each run deliberately attempts an invalid completion
before registering evidence and verifies that source work remains unfinished.

## Workloads and boundaries

- **Lightweight:** explicit bounded observations retain lightweight management;
  goal/rule/acceptance consumption and engineering completion remain enforced.
- **Upgrade:** an occupied contract edit is rejected. After explicit claim release,
  the source acceptance grows to include a separate tradeoff artifact. The same work
  identity upgrades, consumes new context, reacquires its claim and satisfies all criteria.
- **Wait:** a persisted question survives a server restart. Progress is blocked until
  the reply is recorded. Management upgrades and the original work identity survives.
- **Dependencies:** the successor is initially blocked. The predecessor produces a
  real synthetic artifact and passes completion before the successor becomes ready.
  The separate [host example](../reference/source-changes.md) tests bounded outstanding
  parallel work and resource conflicts; this timing workload runs the dependency in order.
- **Unknown result:** the native server really saves a checkpoint, and the fixture
  withholds its response from the host. After restart the host queries the original
  request and exact checkpoint, without replaying the checkpoint or business executor.

The [oracle](../../../tests/benchmarks/workflow/oracle.py) independently checks actual
artifacts, limitations, exact criteria, context facts and one business execution per
work. Its negative tests reject missing rules, changed identities, missing coverage
and duplicate execution. A reported source status alone cannot pass the oracle.

## What is counted

Raw input/output for every CLI invocation and MCP request is recorded in a new
ignored output directory. The recorder includes failed/rejected calls, restart
discovery and recovery lookups. `wire_*_bytes` counts actual MCP JSON lines and
serialized CLI argv/returned bytes; CLI argv is a measurement encoding, not a
network protocol. `tool_text_bytes` counts the MCP text content once and CLI stdout.
MCP wire output separately includes both structured content and its text representation.
Actual client rendering may feed a different subset to a model.

Report assembly and artifact creation are separately recorded host operations.
`maintenance_*` includes maintenance API traffic plus report assembly bytes/time;
per-run phase records separate context, continuity, guard checks, recovery and
verification. Model-independent artifact production is included in wall time.
Fixture construction and initial binary hashing occur before the measured intake.
There are no real user-think times, model calls, provider retries or external network
executors in these fixtures. Explicit retries/replays are counted from repeated
mutation identities, including rejected requests, rather than assumed to be zero.

**Model input/output/reasoning tokens and fees remain `null`.** UTF-8 bytes, context
token estimates and fewer tool calls are not a provider billing receipt. The older
[context selection benchmark](README.md) measures a different denominator.

Actual project self-use and its private sources/receipts stay outside this public
dataset. Candidate use does not replace an existing pinned release binding or supply
native enterprise Agent-client E4 acceptance.

## Reproduce

Use Python 3.11+ and trusted native binaries built from one known source commit:

```sh
cargo build --locked -p awr-cli -p awr-mcp
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/benchmarks/workflow -v
python3 tests/benchmarks/workflow/run.py \
  --awr target/debug/awr --mcp target/debug/awr-mcp \
  --runtime-source-sha <full-commit-that-built-both-binaries> \
  --output .local/workflow-measurement-001 --repetitions 3
```

On Windows use native `.exe` paths. Use a new output directory each time. The result
binds the actual binary hashes, harness hashes, environment and declared source SHA.
Only reviewed aggregate data belongs in Git; raw source, identities, operation
receipts and failures remain local. Native platform CI runs the oracle and all ten
strategy/workload combinations on each actual platform, without timing thresholds.

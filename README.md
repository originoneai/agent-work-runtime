# Agent Work Runtime (AWR)

**Persistent work state and minimal context for long-running AI agents.**

AWR indexes project goals, plans, rules and task ledgers, tracks work across sessions, and compiles the context needed for the task happening now.

> Git versions code. AWR versions agent work.

## Project status

This repository contains the original product design, the V1 scope contract, and the implementation ledger. **The Rust runtime has not been implemented or released yet.** See the [generated work index](ledger/README.md) for current progress.

The V1 plan contains **59 delivery work items**, **8 complete business acceptance scenarios**, and **10 benchmark targets**. Three repository preparation items are counted separately. A passing planning check validates the plan's structure; it does not prove runtime behavior.

## Product model

- **Intent:** goals, plans, rules and acceptance criteria.
- **State:** tasks, dependencies, blockers, ownership claims and work branches.
- **Memory:** decisions, events, evidence, checkpoints and artifact references.
- **Context:** deterministic, revision-bound context for a specific agent, task, branch and token budget.

Project files remain authoritative for project facts. SQLite holds their projections and is authoritative for AWR-generated runtime state. Historical events stay separate from current state. Hard rules and critical work facts remain intact during context selection.

## V1 direction

Local-first Rust binary, SQLite/WAL/FTS5, CLI and eight focused MCP tools. Feature development comes first, followed by agent integration, security hardening, system validation and release preparation.

Target workflow — these commands are planned, not currently executable:

```sh
awr init
awr context bootstrap
awr context compile --work <work-id> --budget 4000
awr session checkpoint
awr session resume
```

Bootstrap targets at most 1,000 tokens; work context targets at most 5,000 tokens, with 100% recall of required hard facts. Over-budget hard context must be reported explicitly.

## Design and implementation

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Original design](docs/design/agent-work-runtime-design.md) | Unmodified product and engineering proposal |
| [Goals](docs/GOALS.md) | Intended outcomes and V1 scope |
| [Plan](docs/PLAN.md) | Feature-first delivery sequence |
| [Rules](docs/RULES.md) | Authority, evidence and development rules |
| [V1 contract](contracts/awr-v1.json) | Versioned scope, targets and acceptance matrix |
| [Work ledger](ledger/work-ledger.yaml) | Authoritative status, dependencies and acceptance per item |
| [Work index](ledger/README.md) | Generated readable view of the ledger |
| [Kickoff](docs/KICKOFF.md) | First implementation task and handoff instructions |

## Validate the planning baseline

Python 3.11+ is sufficient for this repository's planning tools. Rust prerequisites will be pinned in the first implementation item.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv/bin/python scripts/check_ledger.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/check_ledger.py --render
```

The checker verifies scope counts, task dependencies, design coverage, scenario isolation, evidence metadata and the generated index. It does not run AWR or replace independent acceptance review.

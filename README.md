# Agent Work Runtime (AWR)

**Persistent work state and minimal context for long-running AI agents.**

AWR indexes project goals, plans, rules and task ledgers, tracks work across sessions, and compiles the context needed for the task happening now.

> Git versions code. AWR versions agent work.

## Project status

Implementation has started with the Rust workspace, shared domain types and CLI entry point. **AWR is in development and has not been released.** See the [generated work index](ledger/README.md) for current progress and supported milestones.

The V1 plan contains **59 delivery work items**, **8 complete business acceptance scenarios**, and **10 benchmark targets**. Three repository preparation items are counted separately. A passing planning check validates the plan's structure; it does not prove runtime behavior.

## Product model

- **Intent:** goals, plans, rules and acceptance criteria.
- **State:** tasks, dependencies, blockers, ownership claims and work branches.
- **Memory:** decisions, events, evidence, checkpoints and artifact references.
- **Context:** deterministic, revision-bound context for a specific agent, task, branch and token budget.

Project files remain authoritative for project facts. SQLite holds their projections and is authoritative for AWR-generated runtime state. Historical events stay separate from current state. Hard rules and critical work facts remain intact during context selection.

## V1 direction

Local-first Rust binary, SQLite/WAL/FTS5, CLI and eight focused MCP tools. Feature development comes first, followed by agent integration, security hardening, system validation and release preparation.

Target workflow — these commands are planned, not currently executable:

```sh
awr init
awr context bootstrap
awr context compile --work <work-id> --budget 4000
awr session checkpoint
awr session resume
```

Bootstrap targets at most 1,000 tokens; work context targets at most 5,000 tokens, with 100% recall of required hard facts. Over-budget hard context must be reported explicitly.

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Original design](docs/design/agent-work-runtime-design.md) | Unmodified product and engineering proposal |
| [Goals](docs/GOALS.md) | Intended outcomes and V1 scope |
| [Plan](docs/PLAN.md) | Feature-first delivery sequence |
| [Rules](docs/RULES.md) | Authority, evidence and development rules |
| [V1 contract](contracts/awr-v1.json) | Versioned scope, targets and acceptance matrix |
| [Work ledger](ledger/work-ledger.yaml) | Authoritative status, dependencies and acceptance per item |
| [Work index](ledger/README.md) | Generated readable view of the ledger |
| [Kickoff](docs/KICKOFF.md) | First implementation task and handoff instructions |

## Validate the planning baseline

Build the current CLI with Rust 1.93.1:

```sh
cargo build --locked -p awr-cli
target/debug/awr --help
target/debug/awr --version
```

The CLI currently exposes help, version and read-only database diagnostics:

```sh
target/debug/awr --json doctor --database path/to/awr.db
```

The storage library can create and reopen versioned AWR databases with WAL, foreign keys and migration metadata. Before project initialization lands, developers can exercise it with `cargo run -p awr-store --example open_store -- path/to/awr.db` (the parent directory must exist). Other work commands remain explicitly unsupported until their ledger items are delivered.

The source library also resolves configured local files and immutable Git blobs. It has been used to read this project's own goal, plan, rules and work ledger:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p awr-source --example read_source -- . examples/source-manifest/project.toml 0
```

This entry point reports source metadata and fingerprints. Domain parsing, indexing and work context compilation are delivered by subsequent ledger items.

Python 3.11+ is sufficient for this repository's planning tools. Rust is pinned in rust-toolchain.toml and dependency resolution is committed in Cargo.lock.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv/bin/python scripts/check_ledger.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/check_ledger.py --render
```

The checker verifies scope counts, task dependencies, design coverage, scenario isolation, evidence metadata and the generated index. It does not run AWR or replace independent acceptance review.
